1)(10pts.) Is the propositional formula (A^~B)U(A^C) equivalent to the formula A^(~BUC)?  Write a truth table for both formulas. 

Solution:
A | B | C | (A^~B)U(A^C) | A^(~BUC)
T | T | T |       T      |    T
T | T | F |       F      |    F
T | F | T |       T      |    T
T | F | F |       T      |    T
F | T | T |       F      |    F
F | T | F |       F      |    F
F | F | T |       F      |    F
F | F | F |       F      |    F

Yes, they are equivalent.

2)(10pts.) Use induction to prove that
(n(sum)i=1)*(i^2) = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6. for all n â‰¥ 1.

Solution:
Base case is n = 1
Since both are equal to 1 we can continue.
Assume that the equation is true, using assumption we will need to prove that RHS: (n+1(sum)i=1)*(i^2) = ((n+1)(n+2)(2n+3))/6
This turns to ((2n^3)+(9n^2)+13n+6)/6
LHS: (n(sum)i=1)*(i^2)+(n+1)^2 = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6 + (n+1)^2 = (2n^3+3n^2+n)/6 +(n^2)+2n+1=((2n^3)+(9n^2)+13n+6)/6
The left and right sides are equal.

3)(10pts.) Let a>0 be a real number. Use induction to prove that (1+a)^n >= 1+na for all n>=1

Solution:
Base case is n = 1. Since (1+a)^1 >= 1+1*a we are okay. Next we assume that the equation is true. Using assumption we will prove that 
(1+a)^(n+1) >= 1+(n+1)*a
(1+a)^(n+1) = (1+a)^n*(1+a) >= (1+na)(1+a) = 1+na+a+na^2 = 1+(n+1)a+na^2 >= 1(n+1)*a so it is true.

4)(10pts.) Prove or Disprove: for any sets A,B,C we have A^B âŠ† BUC. If you think the statement isn't always true, then disprove
it by finding specific sets A,B,C where the statement is false.

Solution:
The statement is true. We can prove it by showing that if xâˆˆA^B then xâˆˆBUC. Assume that xâˆˆA^B so we know that both xâˆˆA and xâˆˆB. Since 
xâˆˆB we know that xâˆˆBUC.

For the next two problems, assume that f: A --> B and g: B --> C are total functions. Let h = gof be the composite function so 
h: A --> C.  They are "prove or disprove" problems. If you think the statement isn't always true, then disprove it by drawing an 
arrow diagram of special functions f,g,h where the statement is false.

5)(10pts.) Prove or disprove:  if f and g are both injective ([<=1 arrow in]) then h is injective.

Solution: The statement is true.  Let's prove it.  Suppose f and g are both injective.  We would like to show that h is injective, 
or in other words that h(a) = h(a') ==> a = a'. So assume we have h(a) = h(a'), meaning that g(f(a)) = g(f(a')). Since g is injective 
that means f(a) = f(a').  But then since f is injective that means a = a'

6)(10pts.) Prove or disprove:  if h is a bijection ([= 1 arrow in, = 1 arrow out]) then f is a bijection.

Solution: olution:This statement is false.  See the arrow diagram below.gandfare both total functionsandh=gfis a bijection (you should check this).  However,fis not a bijection.
