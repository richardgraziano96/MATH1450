1)(10 points) Is the propositional formula (A ∨ B) ∧ (~A ∨ C) equivalent to the formula B ∧ C ? If the answer is “yes” you should justify
it, either by writing a truth table for both formulas or by explaining logically why they are equivalent. If the answer is “no” then 
justify it by writing (at least part of) a truth table.
