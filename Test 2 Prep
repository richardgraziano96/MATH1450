1)(10 points) Find the coefficient of (x^2)*y*z in (2x−y+3z)^4.

Solution: (x1+x2(...)xk)^n = (SUM)(i1+i2(...)+i=m)(i,j >= 0) (n(choose)i1+i2(...)+ik)*x1^i+(...)xk^(i*k)
SO (2x-y+3z)^4 = (SUM)(i1+i2+i2=4)(i,j >= 0)(4(choose)i1+i2+i3)*(2x)^i1*(y)^i2*(3z)^i3
(x^2)*y*z is when i1=2, i2=1 and i3=1 SO the terms are (4(choose)(211))(2x)^2*(-y)^1*(3z)^1 = (4!)/(2!*1!*1!) = 12*4*3x^2y^2z = -144x^2yz
SO the Coefficient is -144

2)(10 points) Use any method to prove the “hockey stick identity” (below):
[n(SUM)i=k (n(choose)k) = ((n+1)(choose)(k+1))]

Solution: 
RHS: Counts number of subsets {1...n+1} of size k+1
LHS: It is the number of subsets of size k+1 whose largest element is (i+1)

3)(10 points) Given that i^4 = 24*(i(choose)4)+36*(i(choose)3)+14*(i(choose)2)+(i(choose)1),find a formula for [n(SUM)i=0]*i^4
NOTE: [0(SUM)i=0(i(choose)k) = ((n+1)(choose)(k+1)) and if i < k (i(choose)k = 0 n(SUM)i=k (n(choose)k) = ((n+1)(choose)(k+1))]

Solution: 24*(n+1(choose)5)+36(n+1(choose)4)+14*(n+1(choose)3)+(n+1(choose)2)

4)(10 points) How many ways can we arrange the letters M, A, T, H, I, S, F, U, and N such that none of the words “MATH,” “IS,” or “FUN” 
appear consecutively? For example we do not count the arrangement SFUMATHNI because “MATH” appears consecutively

Solution: 9! without rules. Then we set S1 = "MATH", S2 = "IS", S3 = "FUN" |S1(UNION)S2(UNION)S3| = 8!+7!+6!-6!-5!-4!+3! then we 
subtract those from the ways without rules and get 9!-(8!+7!+6!-6!-5!-4!+3!).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5)(10 points) How many solutions (x1, x2, x3, x4) are there to the equation **x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 13** such that x1, x2, x3 and x4 are
all positive integers?

Solution: Look at Pirates and Gold. Ideal substitute y1 = xi-1 for i = 1,2,3,4. y1+y2+y3+y4 = 9 thus (9+4-1(choose)9) = (12(choose)9)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) (10 points) We have five people A, B, C, D and E. How many ways can we arrange them in a line so that at least one of the following
is true:
(i) A is third in line
(ii) B is fifth in line
(iii) C is third in line, or
(vi) D is fourth in line

Solution: S1->A is third, S2->B is fifth, S3->C is third, S4->D is forth |S1,2,3,4| = 4! so 4*4!-5*3!+2*2!-0 
|Si|-|Si(UNION)Sj|+|Si(UNION)Sj(UNION)Sk|-|Si(UNION)Sj(UNION)Sk(UNION)Sl|

7)(10 points) Suppose D = (V, E) is a digraph in which every vertex has outdegree at least 1. Prove that D contains a cycle.

Solution: V1(is an element of)V, and let V2 be any vertex such that (V1->V2)(Since V1 has outdegree >= 1 we can find such a V2)
Let V(i+1) be any vertex (Vi -> V(i+1)). However, since V is finite we must have some Vk = Vj where k/=j.
Let k be the smallest subscript Vk(is an element of){V1...V(k+1)} Vk=Vj for some j < k. SO D has the cycle (Vj, V(j+1)..V(k+1),Vi)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8)(10 points) We say a walk in a digraph D = (V, E) is closed if the first and last vertex on the walk are the same. 
Let v be a vertex in D. Prove that the shortest closed walk starting and ending at v is a cycle.

Solution: Let (V0,V1...Vp) be a shortest walk with V0=Vp=V. **Contradiction** We have Vi = Vj for i /= j say i < j. But the walk
(V0...Vi,Vj+1...Vp) that is shorter than p(Which is suppose to be the shortest length of such a walk) -><-
