1)(30pts.) For this problem, imagine that a bug is standing on the xy-plane. The bug starts at (0,0). If the bug is standing at the 
point (x,y) it can take two types of steps: The bug can move one unit up to the point (x,y+1) or it can move one unit to the right, 
so it can move (x+1,y)

a)(5pts.) Explain why there are (200 (choose) 100) ways for the bug to get from (0,0) to (100,100).

Solution:
The bug takes 200 steps (100 up, 100 right) so you have to choose which 100 steps are up.

b)(10pts.) How many ways are there to go from (0,0) to (100,100) if the bug MUST go through the point (20,30)?

Solution:
(50 (choose) 20) [50 possible moves must choose 20 of them] * (150 (choose) 80) 
[200 total moves minus the 50 moves 100 choose moves minus the 20 moves from before]

c)(15pts.) How many ways are there to go from (0,0) to (100,100) if the bug must go through at LEAST one of the points (40,50), (50,60),
(70,90)?

Solution:
p1:(90 (choose) 40) * (110 (choose) 60) +
p2:(110 (choose) 50) * (90 (choose) 50) +
p3:(160 (choose) 70) * (40 (choose) 30) -
p1 & p2: (90 (choose) 40) * (20 (choose) 10) * (90 (choose) 50) -
p1 & p3: (90 (choose) 40) * (70 (choose) 30) * (40 (choose) 30) -
p2 & p3: (110 (choose) 50) * (50 (choose) 20) * (40 (choose) 30) +
p1 & p2 & p3: (90 (choose) 40) * (20 (choose) 10) * (50 (choose) 20) * (40 (choose) 30)

2)(15pts.) Recall Pascal's Identity, which states that (n(choose)k) = (n-1(choose)k) + (n-1(choose)k-1) Use induction to prove that
[n(SUM)i=3 (i(choose)3) = ((n+1)(choose)4)]. Base case should be 3

Solution: 
Base case: n = 3 both sides equal 1. 
Induction step: Assume [n(SUM)i=3 (i(choose)3) = ((n+1)(choose)4)] 
so [n+1(SUM)i=3 (i(choose)3) = [n(SUM)i=3 (i(choose)3) + ((n+1)(choose)3)] = ((n+1)(choose)4) + ((n+1)(choose)3) = ((n+2)(choose)4) 
which is pascal's identity.

3)(15pts.) How many solutions (x1,x2,x3,x4) are there to the equation x1+x2+x3+x4=15 such that x1>=0, x2>=1, x3>=1, x4>=2?

Solution: 
x1+(x2-1)+(x3-1)+(x4-2) = 15-1-1-2 = 11
(11+4-1(choose)4-1) = (14(choose)3) OR (14(choose)11)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)(15pts.) We have four people. How many ways can we arrange them so that at least one is true:
i) A is first in line
ii) B is second in line
iii) C is third in line
iv) D is fourth in line

Solution:
4*3!-6*2!+4*1!-1(*1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5)(15pts.) Let D be a digraph and let u,v be any two vertices, conside a walk that starts at u and ends at v that has the shortest 
length. Prove that this walk must be a path

Solution:
Let (U0,U1...Up) be a shortest walk with U1=Xp=V. **Contradiction** We have Ui = Uj for i /= j, i < j. But the walk
(U0...Ui,Uj+1...Xp) that is shorter than p(Which is suppose to be the shortest length of such a walk) which is a contradiction. Thus
we can see A shortest walk has to be dist(u,v)
