1)(30pts.) For this problem, imagine that a bug is standing on the xy-plane. The bug starts at (0,0). If the bug is standing at the point
(x,y) it can take two types of steps: The bug can move one unit up to the point (x,y+1) or it can move one unit to the right, so it can
move (x+1,y)

a)(5pts.) Explain why there are (200 (choose) 100) ways for the bug to get from (0,0) to (100,100).

Solution:
The bug takes 200 steps (100 up, 100 right) so you have to choose which 100 steps are up.

b)(10pts.) How many ways are there to go from (0,0) to (100,100) if the bug MUST go through the point (20,30)?

Solution:
(50 (choose) 20) [50 possible moves must choose 20 of them] * (150 (choose) 80) 
[200 total moves minus the 50 moves 100 choose moves minus the 20 moves from before]

c)(15pts.) How many ways are there to go from (0,0) to (100,100) if the bug must go through at LEAST one of the points (40,50), (50,60),
(70,90)?
p1:(90 (choose) 40) * (110 (choose) 60) +
p2:(110 (choose) 50) * (90 (choose) 50) +
p3:(160 (choose) 70) * (40 (choose) 30) -
p1 & p2: (90 (choose) 40) * (20 (choose) 10) * (90 (choose) 50) -

p1 & p2 & p3: (90 (choose) 40) * (20 (choose) 10) * (50 (choose) 20) * (40 (choose) 30)
